            Every new JIRA ticket page you open from now will have an extra

      <h2>How to use</h2>
      <div id="how-to-cont">
        <img
          src="./images/help/how-to-use-diagram.jpg"
          alt="how to use diagram"
        />
        <ol>
          <li>Ticket name</li>
          <li>Ticket ID</li>
          <li>Wokrflow type</li>
          <li>Market</li>
          <li>Submarket</li>
          <li>Settings button</li>
          <li>Information & Help button</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        Application scans the whole page and automatically saves info needed,
        like market country, ticket #, description.
      </p>

        You still have control and can edit text fields in case it makes a
        mistake.

      <h2>What can go wrong</h2>
      <p>
        First of all, this is just a robot on rails, if one of the steps fails,
        the program can't continue.
      </p>
      <p>Obviously I tried to find workarounds, but still.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Do not change tabs while it's creating the workflow, it likes the
            attention
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Application <b>CAN NOT</b> pick the submarket for Belgium and
            Switzerland, it automatically defaults to NL for Belgium and DE for
            Switzerland
          </p>
          <p><b>For CH and BE you have to check the submarket!</b></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you have the setting that automatically navigates to newly
            created workflow checked, and the new workflow <b>IS NOT</b> empty,
            it means that the workflow with same id was already created, you
            will have to double check and delete the workflow you created.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Enjoy and contact Farid Mammadbayov for extra info.</p>
